#Create a python that is able to calculate the simple intest given the principle as 50000, rate as 5% as 8 years .SI= (p*r*t)/100
principle= 50000
rate = 5
time = 8
Simpleinterest = (principle * rate * time)/ 100
print("The simle interest is: ", Simpleinterest)


#Assignment
#1.Write a python that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78 kgs and height is 1.75 meters.BMI = (weight)/(height squared)
weight = 78
height = 1.75
BMI =(weight)/ (height **2)
print("This is the BMI", BMI)
# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
length = 48
width = 25
area = length * width
perimeter = (length + width)* 2
print("this is the area", area)
print("this is the perimeter", perimeter)
# Research on python list, tuple and Dictionary Data types.
thislist = ["apple" , "banana" ,"cherry" ,"apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
